## RufaSok Introduction

This is a minimalistic version of an interactive, OpenGL Sokoban puzzle game platform with 3 external solvers, and 3 embedded auto-solvers designed to help you to learn to solve puzzles on your own. It includes a reverse game option where the boxes must be pulled back from their goals to their original positions.

The forward platform is called "forsok". Its objective is to push all the movable boxes onto their goals.  And the embedded solvers can help you a little, or a lot, when you get stuck.

And now, when you think you are ready for it, try solving the various puzzles backward using the new backward mode platform called "baksok".

### Controls

solver keys [within parentheses]:

*  (.) iplr; for small or dense puzzles
*  (,) ibox; medium
*  (=) hbox [most capable]

*  (m) sets hbox method [see details below]

movement keys: 

*   i    j    k    l
*   w    a    s    d
*  (up) (lf) (dn) (rt)

For baksok use (ctrl)-key with a movement key to "PULL" a box.


other common key functions:

*  (+) increase wait timeout (numKeypad)
*  (-) decrease wait timeout (numKeypad)
*  (u) undo

*  (n) next level current file
*  (p) previous level current file

*  (shift)+(n) skip ahead 10 levels in current file
*  (shift)+(p) skip back 10 levels in current file

*  (ctrl)+(n) next file
*  (ctrl)+(p) previous file

*  (z) set a setpoint
*  (r) reset to z-key setpoint (restarts if no setpoint)
*  (ctrl)+(r) restart from beginning

*  (x) dump current puzzle state to a file that can be input later

*  (esc) quit

--------------------------------------------
## Features

* runs on Windows, OSX, Linux;  New linux binary now runs on many linux distros!
* uses GLFW3;
* uses OpenAL for applause sound;
* all runtime files are in ./data/
* all puzzle files are in ./games/
* includes 3 external autosolvers:  iplr3r, ibox3r, hbox
* includes 3 embedded autosolvers that help you to learn.
* no installation
* no dependencies
* simply unzip in your Downloads directory, and run;
* or unzip onto a USB flash drive [w/same file format] and run.

[namechanges due to new backward (puller) game]
To start the game type:

on linux:
   forsok

on osx:
   forsok_osx

on windows:
   wforsok.bat

----------------------------------------------
## Embedded Autosolver Function
Three autosolvers are now embedded within this application so that pressing the (=)-key or (,)-key or (.)-key at any time initiates an attempt to solve the present state of the current puzzle within a limited amount of time.  If successful then you will see an onscreen prompt to continue to press the same key to single-step toward the solution.  Otherwise you will see no such prompt.  These three embedded solvers are good for small and dense layouts;  but not so good at large, sparse puzzles.

The 3rd alternate solver [hbox] is initiated with the (=)-key. It is the most capable embedded solver.

Thus, you can give yourself a headstart toward a correct solution by limited use of this feature.  Once you think you can solve it yourself, stop using the solver and proceed manually.  This really helps when you cannot see what your next move should be.

Note also that the solvers can tell you when you have gone too far and gotten yourself into a deadlock. If you periodically test to see if a solution is available as you proceed manually, then if you go too far you will suddenly find no solution is available. This means you need to undo (u) until a solution is once again available.

Embedded autosolver failure might imply the present state of the puzzle is impossible to solve, or simply that the autosolver failed due to time constraint, or insufficient capability.

Note: all 3 solvers can fail if the puzzle is too large or difficult. However, be aware thatafter making a few good moves yourself, the autosolvers might then be capable of finding a solution. An extreme example is Xsokoban puzzle #19 of 90. After making a single [correct] move, hbox can solve it in 60 seconds using method 23, yet hbox cannot solve it from the beginning!

The default **timeout** used by embedded solvers is 10 seconds, but is adjustable using the (+)-key or (-)-key on the number keypad to increment or decrement by 10 seconds per press. This is the time to wait for the internal autosolvers before giving up.

Also, the **method** used by embedded solver Hbox is now set using the m-key...



### Method options for hbox:
There are several hbox solution methods to choose from including 5 basic methods, 
each of which has several variations, because hbox is currently being used 
as a research tool.
See ~/docs/solmethods.txt for choices available within this RufasSok app.
See ~/docs/SolMethodsIndex.txt for an exhaustive listing.

Even more information can be found by studying the documents in:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/hbox4/files/latest/download




## Included External Autosolvers
Remember that there are still three external autosolvers without time constraints.  Subject to several limitations, typing: "solver-name puzzle-file-name.sok maxlevels level-number" will attempt to solve a particular puzzle for you, where solver-name is either "iplr3r" or "ibox3r".  There are many large or sparse [lishout] puzzles the first two solvers cannot handle, but they are pretty good at sovling the small dense ones.  Use the script ccc.sh to compile either solver for your operating system (assuming the presence of an Ada compiler).

To run type:  [exeName puzzleFile LevelToSolve]

EG on windows type:
   external_solvers\iplr3r.exe games\pico_22.sok 3
   ...to solve the 3rd level in file pico_22.sok.

EG on Linux type
   external_solvers/ibox3r_gnu games/pico_22.sok 3

EG on OSX type
   external_solvers/hbox_osx games/pico_22.sok 3

----------------------------------------------

## what is special about this project?

It uses the Ada programming language and modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Compiles and runs on Windows, OSX, GNU/Linux systems.

Focusing on portability, transparency, and open source freedom, this project relies exclusively on F.O.S.S. tools:  a thin GLFW3 binding, a thin OpenGL binding, a PNG reader by Stephen Sanguine & Dimitry Anisimkov, and a GNAT compiler.

The linux-build can run on multiple Linux distros!
The Windows build can run on Win10 + Win11.

I have 0 testers ;) and would appreciate any feedback...
Open source Ada developers are welcome to help improve or extend this app.
Developer or not, send comments, suggestions or questions to:
fastrgv@gmail.com


------------------------------------------------

## Setup & Running:

Mac/OSX users see "osx-setup.txt".
Windows users see "windows-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  

* On Linux & Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this. The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".

* On OSX, Keka works well for 7Z files. The command-line for Keka is:
   * /Applications/Keka.app/Contents/MacOS/Keka --cli 7z x (filename.7z)

After the archive is unzipped...

Users may then open a terminal window, cd to install-directory, then, at the command line, type the executable name to start the game.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In Linux type: 

   forsok


You can also use the Windows executable under wine, thusly:
   * wine cmd < wforsok.bat
   * wine binw64/forsok.exe

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users type:  

   wforsok.bat 

or:

   binw64\forsok.exe
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac users type:

   forsok_osx

----------------------------------------------------------------------



The install-directory should contain subdirectories named "data", "libs", "games", "skins", "src", "buildScripts", "binw64", "docs".

Pusher movement is accomplished using the arrow keys or the WASD keys.

rufasok has the following skin options:
* gray bkgd
* star bkgd
* water bkgd
* antique desk skin
* plain and simple
...the (c)-key now cycles thru the skins (c=color)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Other Details

The (m) key brings up a menu to select a solution Method for the hbox solver.

The (h) key brings up a help menu that looks something like this:

 Movement: ijkl, wasd, or arrowKeys(up,lf,dn,rt)
 (esc) quit     (u) undo
 (m)  set hbox method
 (r) restore-setpt  (ctrl)+(r) restart
 (n) next-level this set
 (p) previous-level this set
 (ctrl)+(p) = previous puzzle set
 (ctrl)+(n) = next puzzle set
 (z)  redefine setPoint Zero
 (q)  Quiet move sound
 (c)  next skin Color
 (kp+), (kp-)  +timeout, -timeout

 (.)   solver: (iplr)
 (,)   solver: (ibox)
 (=)   solver: (hbox)

 (b)     show Box-invalid cells
 (spc) show freeSpace cells
 (x) dump puzzle to Pdump.sok

-------------------------------------------------------
* use mouse drag to change size of puzzle window

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Linux Note:  a "mouse" or "sloppy" window focus policy might allow
   window focus to slip away while changing puzzles (if the
   new window no longer includes the pointer).  In this case,
   simply move the cursor back onto the puzzle window.  This
   annoyance does NOT occur with a systemwide "click" policy.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Problems with "iplr3r" or "ibox3r" embedded solvers
These are old solvers that have significant limitations,
including rapid growth of memory usage, for puzzles that are 
too large or have too many boxes to handle. 
They seem to still exit gracefully, and when they do, 
simply use "hbox" using the equal-key. On the other
hand, "iplr3r" will generally give the most efficient 
solutions, when it does work. So it's usually worth trying first.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Adding Your Own Sokoban Files

Note that the file naming conventions must be maintained now that dynamic file loading is done after reading the ./games/ directory.  No underscores are permitted except one that precedes the integer that indicates the number of levels in the file.  The name format is thus anyname_nnn.sok.  Note that there is a standardized format for the online sokoban files themselves that I have attempted to respect and maintain.


## Single File Mode

A specific sokoban file may be loaded by naming it on the terminal window command line with the following syntax:

   forsok sokfilepath maxlevels startlevel


For example you could type

   "forsok_osx games/original_50.sok 50 2"  (on Mac/OSX)

   "forsok games/original_50.sok 50 2"  (on linux)

   "wforsok.bat games/original_50.sok 50 2"  (on Windows)

to tackle level 2 from the original_50 sokoban file.  In this single-file mode, you can still use the next-level(n) & previous-level(p) keys, however, the next/previous files (R-shift/L-shift) keys are disabled.

A prior puzzle dump may also be read in and play resumed thusly:

	"forsok Pdump.sok 1 1"  (forsok in linux)
	"baksok Rdump.sok 1 1"  (baksok in linux)



## Single File Playback Mode (new as of 20nov25)

If you happen to have an externally generated solution string in a file, along with the puzzle file, (possibly in the same file) then you can load both to single step through the solution using the following commandline syntax:

   forsok puzzleFile maxlevels startlevel solutionFile

For example:

   "forsok_osx games/original_50.sok 50 2 sol2"  (on Mac/OSX)

   "forsok games/original_50.sok 50 2 sol2"  (on linux)

   "wforsok.bat games/original_50.sok 50 2 sol2"  (on Windows)

where "sol2" is the name of the solution file [that contains only ONE solution]. **It must contain the word "Solution" on the line immediately preceeding the standard solution string.**

This new mode is experimental and not user friendly, but I needed it myself to see how to begin solving a difficult puzzle (sasquatch7 #40). So I solved it using "Festival", then watched the playback. By the way, my copies of Takaken74 & Sokolution could not solve this puzzle in 30 minutes!





## Addendum for the new Reverse-Sokoban game

I included a new Puller-Sokoban app:

* wbaksok.bat (MsWin)
* baksok (linux)
* baksok_osx (Mac/OSX)

Most keys work as before, but to PULL a box next to the puller,
press the Ctrl-Key while using the arrow-keys or WASD.
You can also use the numeric-keypad-arrows  U=kp8, L=kp4, R=kp6, D=kp2
to PULL the boxes (reminder: boxes are no longer pushable). 

Hbox, the most capable autosolver, is invoked with the (=)-key.
Now, the other 2, less-capable solvers have also been added.
The (,)-key invokes ibox3r, while the (.)-key invokes iplr3r. These
last two have not been adequately tested yet, but preliminary
tests seemed Ok. Just as in the forward game, forsok, these solvers
can be invoked and abandoned at any time to help you find the next
good move. And just as before, they might fail to find a solution
within the time constraints. This often means that you made a bad move
that renders the problem unsolvable. If so, you can undo your recent
moves with the (u)-key until it IS solvable.

To solve the backward problem, you MUST end up with the puller on the
puller-goal-cell, indicated by a magenta color. It is not enough to
just get all the boxes on their goals.

In the reversed problem, there is uncertainty about the Initial puller position.
So, before you begin, you can cycle thru all of the candidates using the "i"-key.
But note that some candidates may be unsolvable, so choose wisely. 
OTOH, if the autosolver is capable of solving the problem, when invoked, it will 
automatically move the puller to a valid start position, at which time you can 
try solving it yourself, or continue to use the autosolver and step towards the 
solution with each (=)-key press.


## Limitations
These apps can handle up to a maximum of 128 boxes, 64 rows/cols, and 256 box-valid interior cells.



## Build Requirements:
* a recent GNAT Ada compiler from AdaLibre;
* graphics card that supports OpenGL version 3.3 or later;

## Build instructions:

In the ~/buildScripts/ directory try:

**Mac/OSX** => obuildall.sh

**Linux** => lbuildall.sh

**msWin64** => setpath64.bat + w64buildall.bat

**Of course, the above scripts need to be adjusted
to reference your actual compiler installation directory.**
Please read carefully: ~/docs/gnuAdaOnWindows.txt.

-------------------------------------------------------

If your linux distribution is old, it might not run, and you will need to recompile.

Note that linux users with wine installed can run with the command:

   wine binw64/forsok.exe


If the delivered GNU/Linux binary does not run, try:

* Use wine and the Windows EXE, as above; or

* Manually install GNU Ada.
* Rerun the compile script lbuildall.sh.


The commands to build the external autosolvers:

on Linux:
   cccgnu.sh ibox3r
   cccgnu.sh iplr3r
   cccgnu.sh hbox

and on Windows:
   ccc64.bat ibox3r
   ccc64.bat iplr3r
   ccc64.bat hbox

and on OSX:
   cccosx.sh ibox3r
   cccosx.sh iplr3r
   cccosx.sh hbox
