## RufaSok Introduction

This is a minimalistic version of an interactive, OpenGL Sokoban puzzle game with 3 external solvers, and 3 embedded auto-solvers designed to help you to learn to solve puzzles on your own.

The objective is to push all the movable objects onto their targets.  And the embedded solvers can help you a little, or a lot, when you get stuck.

### Controls

solver keys [within parentheses]:

*	(.) hbox5 [most capable]; 
*	(=) bfs#1 [for small puzzles]; 
*	(,) bfs#2 [medium]
*  (0..5) sets hbox5 method [see details below]

movement keys:	

*	w    a    s    d
*	(up) (lf) (dn) (rt)

other keys:

*	(u) undo
*	(n) next level current set
*	(p) previous level current set
*	(Lshift) previous set
*	(Rshift) next set
*	(z) set a setpoint
*	(r) reset to z-key setpoint
*	(o) restart from beginning
*	(esc) quit

--------------------------------------------
## Features

* runs on Windows, OSX, Linux;  New linux binary now runs on many linux distros!
* uses GLFW3;
* uses OpenAL for applause sound;
* all runtime files are in ./data/
* all puzzle files are in ./games/
* includes 3 external autosolvers:  iplr3r, ibox3r, hbox5
* includes 3 embedded autosolvers that help you to learn.
* no installation
* no dependencies
* simply unzip in your Downloads directory, and run;
* or unzip onto a USB flash drive [w/same file format] and run.

To start the game type:

on linux:
	rufasok_gnu

on osx:
	rufasok_osx

on windows:
	rufasok64.bat

----------------------------------------------
## Embedded Autosolver Function
Three autosolvers are now embedded within this application so that pressing the (=)-key or (,)-key or (.)-key at any time initiates an attempt to solve the present state of the current puzzle within a limited amount of time.  If successful then you will see an onscreen prompt to continue to press the same key to single-step toward the solution.  Otherwise you will see no such prompt.  These three embedded solvers are good for small and dense layouts;  but not so good at large, sparse puzzles.

The 3rd alternate solver [hbox5] is initiated with the (.)-key. It is the most capable embedded solver.

Note: all 3 solvers can fail if the puzzle is too large (256 or more valid puzzle positions).

Thus, you can give yourself a headstart toward a correct solution by limited use of this feature.  Once you think you can solve it yourself, stop using the solver and proceed manually.  This really helps when you cannot see what your next move should be.

Note also that the solvers can tell you when you have gone too far and gotten yourself into a deadlock. If you periodically test to see if a solution is available as you proceed manually, then if you go too far you will suddenly find no solution is available. This means you need to undo (u) until a solution is once again available.

Embedded autosolver failure might imply the present state of the puzzle is impossible to solve, or simply that the autosolver failed due to time constraint, or insufficient capability.

Finally, a single command-line argument (decimal float) specifies a persistent timeout interval [in seconds] to wait for the internal autosolver before giving up.  The default is 10.0 seconds.  A new setting remains in effect until a different setting is specified using a command-line argument.


The default method used by embedded solver Hbox5 [ (.)-key ] can now be set using the k-key, where k is 0..5.


### 6 method options for hbox5:

	* 0 "quickest"
	* 1 more "efficient"
	* 2 suppress hungarian estimator (eg. for dense puzzles)
	* 3 like 0 but tries to reduce total moves
	* 4 like 1 but tries to reduce total moves [default]
	* 5 like 2 but tries to reduce total moves

For further details see:

	* https://sourceforge.net/projects/hbox4/    (4 is not a typo)





## External Autosolvers
Remember that there are still three external autosolvers without time constraints.  Subject to several limitations, typing: "solver-name puzzle-file-name.sok maxlevels level-number" will attempt to solve a particular puzzle for you, where solver-name is either "iplr3r" or "ibox3r".  There are many large or sparse [lishout] puzzles the first two solvers cannot handle, but they are pretty good at sovling the small dense ones.  Use the script ccc.sh to compile either solver for your operating system (assuming the presence of an Ada compiler).

To run type:  [exeName puzzleFile LevelToSolve]

EG on windows type:
	binw64\iplr3r.exe games\pico_22.sok 3
	...to solve the 3rd level in file pico_22.sok.


EG on Linux type
	hbox5_gnu games/pico_22.sok 3

EG on OSX type
	hbox5_osx games/pico_22.sok 3

----------------------------------------------

## what is special about this project?

It uses the Ada programming language and modern OpenGL methods, with textures, shaders and uniforms.  Compiles and runs on Windows, OSX, GNU/Linux systems.

Focusing on portability, transparency, and open source freedom, this project relies exclusively on F.O.S.S. tools:  a thin GLFW3 binding, a thin OpenGL binding, a PNG reader by Stephen Sanguine & Dimitry Anisimkov, and a GNAT compiler.

The linux-build can run on multiple Linux distros!
The Windows build can run on Win10 + Win11.

I am short of testers, and would appreciate any feedback...
Open source Ada developers are welcome to help improve or extend this app.
Developer or not, send comments, suggestions or questions to:
fastrgv@gmail.com


------------------------------------------------

## Setup & Running:

Mac/OSX users see "osx-setup.txt".
Windows users see "windows-setup.txt".

Unzip the archive.  

* On Linux & Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this. The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".

* On OSX, Keka works well for 7Z files. The command-line for Keka is:
	* /Applications/Keka.app/Contents/MacOS/Keka --cli 7z x (filename.7z)

After the archive is unzipped...

Users may then open a terminal window, cd to install-directory, then, at the command line, type the executable name to start the game.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In Linux type: 

	rufasok_gnu

The command

	rufasok_gnu 20.0 

sets the autosolver-wait to 20 seconds...double the default. 
This might help, especially when using the hbox5 method (.)-key, 
which the most powerful of the 3, and automatically quits if the 
memory usage becomes excessive.

You can also use the Windows executable under wine, thusly:
	* wine cmd < rufasok64.bat
	* wine binw64/rufasok.exe

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows users type:  

	rufasok64.bat 

or to reset solver wait to 30 seconds type:

	binw64\rufasok.exe 30.0
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac users type:

	rufasok_osx

or

	rufasok_osx 30.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------



The install-directory should contain subdirectories named "data", "libs", "games", "skins", "src", "buildScripts", "binw64", "docs".

Pusher movement is accomplished using the arrow keys or the WASD keys.

rufasok has the following skin options:
* gray bkgd
* star bkgd
* water bkgd
* antique desk skin
* plain and simple
...the (c)-key now cycles thru the skins (c=color)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Other Details

The (h) key brings up a help menu that looks like this:

* (f)   = grab/keep windows focus toggle (default=off)
* (esc) = exit
* (u)   = undo last move
* (r)   = reset to setpoint
* (o)   = restart Original puzzle
* (n)   = next-puzzle in current file
* (p)   = previous-puzzle in current file
* (R-shift) = next-file
* (L-shift) = previous-file
* (z)   = define setPoint...subsequent presses of (r)-key will restore THIS configuration
* (2,f2) = bigger
* (1,f1) = smaller
* (c)   = next skin Color
* (=)   = try autosolver #1 (iplr3r)
* (.)   = try autosolver #2 (hbox5...most capable)
* (,)   = try autosolver #3 (ibox3r)
* box-click: possible destinations [not perfect]
* goal-click: possible sources [not perfect either]
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Linux Note:  a "mouse" or "sloppy" window focus policy might allow
	window focus to slip away while changing puzzles (if the
	new window no longer includes the pointer).  In this case,
	simply move the cursor back onto the puzzle window.  This
	annoyance does NOT occur with a systemwide "click" policy. 
	But now, the f-key toggles a game policy that forcibly keeps
	focus, although it is generally considered improper to do this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding Your Own Sokoban Files

Note that the file naming conventions must be maintained now that dynamic file loading is done after reading the ./games/ directory.  No underscores are permitted except one that precedes the integer that indicates the number of levels in the file.  The name format is thus anyname_nnn.sok.  Note that there is a standardized format for the online sokoban files themselves that I have attempted to respect and maintain.

Note also that a specific sokoban file may be tested by naming it on the terminal window command line with the following syntax:

	rufasok sokfilepath maxlevels startlevel

where rufasok can be 

	rufasok_gnu, rufasok_osx, or rufasok64.bat

For example on linux you could type

	"rufasok_gnu games/original_50.sok 50 2"

to tackle level 2 from the original_50 sokoban file.  In this single-file mode, you can still use the next-level(n) & previous-level(p) keys, however, the next/previous files (R-shift/L-shift) keys are disabled.








## Build Requirements:
* a recent GNAT Ada compiler from AdaLibre;
* graphics card that supports OpenGL version 3.3 or later;

## Build instructions:

In the ~/buildScripts/ directory try:

**Mac/OSX** => obuildall.sh

**Linux** => lbuildall.sh

**msWin64** => setpath64.bat + w64buildall.bat

Of course, the above windows "setpath" script needs to be adjusted
to reference you actual compiler installation directory.
Please read carefully: ~/docs/gnuAdaOnWindows.txt.

-------------------------------------------------------

The distributed linux executable requires glibc v2.14 or newer.  That means if your distribution is older than june 2011, it probably will not run, and you will need to recompile.

Note that linux users with wine installed can run with the command:

	wine binw64/rufasok.exe


If the delivered GNU/Linux binary does not run, try:

* Use wine and the Windows EXE, as above; or

* Manually install GNU Ada.
* Rerun the compile script lbuildall.sh.


The commands to build the external autosolvers:

on Linux:
	cccgnu.sh ibox3r
	cccgnu.sh iplr3r
	cccgnu.sh hbox5

and on Windows:
	ccc64.bat ibox3r
	ccc64.bat iplr3r
	ccc64.bat hbox5

and on OSX:
	cccosx.bat ibox3r
	cccosx.bat iplr3r
	cccosx.bat hbox5
